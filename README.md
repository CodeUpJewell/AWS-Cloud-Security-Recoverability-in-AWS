# AWS-Cloud-Security-Recoverability-in-AWS
Applied AWS CloudFormation to create highly-available and fault-tolerant solutions to common use cases. By building a multi-availability zone, multi-region database, I focus on database management and how applications can take advantage of distributed infrastructure. I demonstrate the capability and simplicity of cloud migration for your primary database, successfully relocating from one geographical region to another. Similarly, I planned and created a versioned website and demonstrated how it is protected from unexpected conditions, chaos engineering, or malicious disruption. Established vulnerability assessments and made sure to underline availability, security, and operational excellence for enterprise applications when something or someone intends to disrupt your everyday operations.
