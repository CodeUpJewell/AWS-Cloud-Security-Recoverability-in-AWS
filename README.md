This is the first major project in Udacity AWS Cloud Architect Nanodegree.

Project Overview

CloudFormation allows you to use a configuration file written in a YAML file to automate the creation of AWS resources such as VPCs.

You will use a pre-made CloudFormation template to get you started. This will allow you to create some of the infrastructure that you'll need without spending a lot of time learning details that are beyond the scope of this course will build a multi-availability zone, multi-region database. You will demonstrate how applications can use this distributed infrastructure and migrate your primary database from one geographical region to another. You will also create a versioned website and demonstrate how it is protected from accidental or malicious disruption, with an ability to turn-back-the-clock when something disrupts your normal operations.
