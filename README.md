# AWS-Cloud-Security-Recoverability-in-AWS

This is the first major project in Udacity AWS Cloud Architect Nanodegree.

Project Overview

In this project, I will use the AWS CloudFormation to create Virtual Private Clouds. CloudFormation is an AWS service that allows you to create "infrastructure as code". This allows you to define the infrastructure you'd like to create in code, just like you do with software. This has the benefits of being able to share your infrastructure in a common language, use source code control systems to version your infrastructure and allows for documenting and reviewing of infrastructure and infrastructure proposed changes.
CloudFormation allows you to use a configuration file written in a YAML file to automate the creation of AWS resources such as VPCs.

I will use a CloudFormation template to get started. This will allow me to create some of the infrastructure that I'll need without spending a lot of time provisioning specific details. I will first build a multi-availability zone, multi-region database. I will then demonstrate how applications can use this distributed infrastructure and migrate your primary database from one geographical region to another. I will also create a versioned website and demonstrate how it is protected from accidental or malicious disruption, with an ability to turn-back-the-clock when something disrupts your normal operations.
