    Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage = 10 minutes 
Our fail over process will take over, if we have a single AZ outage in our primary availability zones(N. Virginia). Our read replica in N. California Availability Zones will be promoted to the primary. We will work to fix the original primary and service should resume for that AZ within 15 minutes.

    Minimum RTO for a single region outage  = 45 minutes
If we have a single region outage in our primary region, US East (Northern Virginia) , our read replica in US West (Northern California) region will be promoted to the primary. We estimate it will take about 45 minutes to get the original primary region back up and running.
